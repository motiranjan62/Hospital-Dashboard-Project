Hospital Data Analysis

Hello, everyone!
I'm excited to share my Fourth Power BI Project Report, As a data analyst and Power BI developer, I have created a Hospital Dashboard.

ðŸ“ˆ Overview: The initial page of my dashboard presents a clean and straightforward design, highlighting the crucial data that summarize the entire report, including the deaths and number of diseases with the death count.
ðŸ‘¥ Patients Insights: We thoroughly examine and investigate all the specific information about the patient. This helps our healthcare team make wise decisions. I collect data about patients, like where they receive treatment, the illnesses they have, the type of facility they visit, their gender, and other important information. This helps us offer better, more personalized care for every patient. Also easily access the information to get better treatment.
